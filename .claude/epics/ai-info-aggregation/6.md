# Task: RSS Fetching Service

## Description

Create a robust HTTP fetching service for RSS feeds that handles network failures, implements retry logic, and manages rate limiting. The service should work reliably with various RSS feed endpoints and handle common network issues gracefully.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Fetch RSS feeds from HTTP/HTTPS URLs
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff retry logic
- [ ] Handle HTTP status codes (404, 500, redirects)
- [ ] Implement configurable timeout handling
- [ ] Add rate limiting to prevent overwhelming servers
- [ ] Support custom User-Agent headers
- [ ] Handle gzip/deflate compression
- [ ] Cache responses with appropriate TTL
- [ ] Log fetch attempts and failures for monitoring

## Technical Details

- Use native fetch API or axios for HTTP requests
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for failing feeds
- Add request/response interceptors for logging
- Support conditional requests (If-Modified-Since, ETag)
- Handle SSL certificate issues gracefully
- Implement request queuing for rate limiting
- Add metrics collection for fetch success/failure rates

## Dependencies

- [ ] RSS Parser Service (004) - needs parser to process fetched content
- [ ] HTTP client library selection
- [ ] Caching strategy definition
- [ ] Rate limiting configuration

## Effort Estimate

- Size: M
- Hours: 10-14
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done

- [ ] RSS fetching service implemented
- [ ] Retry logic with exponential backoff working
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents server overload
- [ ] Timeout handling prevents hanging requests
- [ ] Unit tests for all error scenarios
- [ ] Integration tests with real RSS feeds
- [ ] Monitoring and logging in place
- [ ] Performance metrics collected
