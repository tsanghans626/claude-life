# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #2

## Overview

Design and implement Prisma schema extensions for AI info aggregation system with RSS sources, articles, and categories. This database-focused task can be parallelized by separating schema design, migration generation, and testing concerns.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Schema Design & Models

**Scope**: Core Prisma model definitions and relationships
**Files**:

- `ai-info/prisma/schema.prisma`
- Type definitions and model structure

**Agent Type**: database-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 2
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream B: Performance Optimization

**Scope**: Database indexes, constraints, and performance tuning
**Files**:

- `ai-info/prisma/schema.prisma` (index definitions)
- Database optimization configurations

**Agent Type**: database-specialist  
**Can Start**: after Stream A basic models complete
**Estimated Hours**: 1.5
**Dependencies**: Stream A (basic models)

### Stream C: Migration & Testing

**Scope**: Generate migrations and test schema changes
**Files**:

- `ai-info/prisma/migrations/*`
- Test database setup and validation

**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: after Stream A & B complete
**Estimated Hours**: 1.5
**Dependencies**: Stream A & B

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files

`ai-info/prisma/schema.prisma` - Streams A & B (coordinate model vs index changes):

- Stream A handles model definitions
- Stream B handles index/constraint additions

### Sequential Requirements

1. Basic model structure before performance optimizations
2. Complete schema before migration generation
3. Migrations before testing

## Conflict Risk Assessment

- **Medium Risk**: Both Stream A and B modify same schema file, but different sections (models vs indexes)
- **Low Risk**: Migration files are generated, minimal conflict potential
- **Mitigation**: Stream A completes basic models before Stream B adds indexes

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: hybrid

Launch Stream A immediately. Start Stream B when Stream A has basic models defined. Launch Stream C when both A & B complete their schema modifications.

## Expected Timeline

With parallel execution:

- Wall time: 2.5 hours
- Total work: 5 hours
- Efficiency gain: 50%

Without parallel execution:

- Wall time: 5 hours

## Notes

- This is primarily a database design task with limited parallelization potential
- Main efficiency comes from separating design/optimization from migration/testing phases
- Consider running database locally for testing migrations
- Ensure proper backup before applying schema changes
