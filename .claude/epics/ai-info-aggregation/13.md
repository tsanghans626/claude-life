# Task: Integration Testing Suite

## Description

Create a comprehensive integration testing suite that validates the complete RSS workflow from feed fetching to UI display. The test suite will cover end-to-end scenarios, error handling, and performance characteristics to ensure system reliability and maintainability across all components.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Full pipeline testing from RSS fetch to UI display
- [ ] Error scenario testing (invalid feeds, network failures, etc.)
- [ ] Background job testing with scheduling and retry logic
- [ ] Database integration testing with cleanup operations
- [ ] API endpoint testing with realistic data loads
- [ ] UI component testing with various data states
- [ ] Performance testing under expected load conditions

## Technical Details

- Use test database with predictable RSS feed sources
- Create test fixtures for various RSS feed formats and edge cases
- Implement integration test helpers for background job simulation
- Add test scenarios for concurrent operations and race conditions
- Create performance benchmarks for key operations
- Include visual regression testing for UI components
- Set up continuous integration test execution

## Dependencies

- [ ] API Endpoints (006) must be functional
- [ ] UI Components (009) must be implemented
- [ ] Background Job System (010) must be operational
- [ ] Test infrastructure and tooling available

## Effort Estimate

- Size: L
- Hours: 16-20
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Integration test suite covers all major workflows
- [ ] Error handling scenarios thoroughly tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established and passing
- [ ] Tests run reliably in CI/CD environment
- [ ] Test documentation provides clear guidance
- [ ] Code coverage meets established thresholds (80%+)
- [ ] All tests pass consistently without flakiness
