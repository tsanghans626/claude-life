# Task: Background Job System

## Description

Implement a scheduled RSS fetching system using Next.js API routes to automatically collect RSS feeds at regular intervals. Create a cron-like scheduling mechanism that runs independently of user interactions, ensuring continuous content aggregation without manual intervention.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Scheduled RSS fetching runs automatically at configured intervals
- [ ] Background jobs can be started, stopped, and monitored
- [ ] Job execution logs are captured for debugging and monitoring
- [ ] Failed jobs are retried with exponential backoff
- [ ] Job status can be queried via API endpoints
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during long-running operations

## Technical Details

- Use Next.js API routes with scheduled execution (cron-style)
- Implement job queue system for managing RSS fetch tasks
- Add job persistence to track execution history and status
- Create monitoring endpoints for job health checks
- Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms
- Use database transactions for job state management

## Dependencies

- [ ] RSS Fetching Service (005) must be complete
- [ ] Database schema supports job tracking
- [ ] Logging infrastructure in place

## Effort Estimate

- Size: L
- Hours: 12-16
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Background job system implemented and running
- [ ] Scheduled RSS fetching working correctly
- [ ] Job monitoring and status tracking operational
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic tested
- [ ] Performance testing shows stable memory usage
- [ ] Documentation covers job configuration and monitoring
