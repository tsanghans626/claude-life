# Task: Article Cleanup Service

## Description

Implement an automated article cleanup service that maintains a 7-day retention policy for RSS articles. The service will run on a scheduled basis to remove old articles, preventing database bloat while maintaining recent content for users. Include monitoring and logging to track cleanup operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Articles older than 7 days are automatically removed
- [ ] Cleanup service runs on configurable schedule (daily recommended)
- [ ] Cleanup operations are logged with statistics (articles removed, errors)
- [ ] Service can be manually triggered via API endpoint
- [ ] Database constraints prevent orphaned data during cleanup
- [ ] Cleanup process handles large datasets efficiently

## Technical Details

- Create scheduled cleanup job using background job system
- Implement batch deletion to handle large numbers of articles
- Add database queries optimized for date-based cleanup
- Include soft delete option for audit trail requirements
- Implement cleanup statistics collection and reporting
- Add configuration for retention period (default 7 days)

## Dependencies

- [ ] Database supports efficient date-based queries
- [ ] Logging system in place for operation tracking

## Effort Estimate

- Size: M
- Hours: 6-8
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Cleanup service implemented and scheduled
- [ ] 7-day retention policy enforced automatically
- [ ] Cleanup operations logged and monitored
- [ ] Manual cleanup trigger available
- [ ] Performance testing with large datasets complete
- [ ] Configuration options documented and tested
